# 🎤 Pronunciation Game - What It Tests

## Overview

This game tests **all major pronunciation challenges** for Spanish speakers learning English. It covers 8 key sound categories with ~60 words total.

---

## 🎯 Sound Categories Tested

### 1. **B/V Sounds** (8 words)
**Challenge:** In Spanish, B and V both sound like /b/. In English, they're different!
- **B = /b/** (lips together): ball, book, beautiful, business, become, before, between, believe
- **V = /v/** (teeth on lip): very, visit, value, vegetable, available, village, various, vase

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers often say "bery" instead of "very" because both letters sound the same in Spanish.

---

### 2. **TH Sounds** (8 words)
**Challenge:** This sound doesn't exist in Spanish at all!
- **Voiced TH /ð/:** this, that, mother, father
- **Voiceless TH /θ/:** think, thank, three, bath

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers often substitute with /d/ or /t/ sounds. "Think" becomes "tink" or "dink".

---

### 3. **R Sounds** (8 words)
**Challenge:** English R is made at the back of the mouth (not rolled like Spanish RR)
- red, car, work, park, bird, world, first, word

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers may roll the R (like "rrrred") or use Spanish R position.

---

### 4. **W Sounds** (8 words)
**Challenge:** No equivalent sound in Spanish
- water, work, window, want, week, where, when, what

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers may say "uater" or "guater" instead of "water".

---

### 5. **SH/CH Sounds** (6 words)
**Challenge:** Similar to Spanish "ch" but different
- **SH /ʃ/:** ship, shop, fish
- **CH /tʃ/:** chair, cheese, church

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers may use Spanish "ch" for both, making "ship" sound like "chip".

---

### 6. **H Sounds** (6 words)
**Challenge:** H is silent in Spanish, breathy in English
- house, help, hot, home, happy, hospital

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers may skip the H sound entirely: "ouse" instead of "house".

---

### 7. **S/Z Sounds** (6 words)
**Challenge:** Z has voice, S doesn't (both sound like S in Spanish)
- **Z /z/:** zoo, zero, rose, music
- **S /s/:** bus, class

**Why it's hard:** Spanish speakers may say "soo" instead of "zoo" because Z sounds like S in Spanish.

---

### 8. **Vowel Challenges** (6 words)
**Challenge:** English has more vowel sounds than Spanish
- Minimal pairs: ship/sheep, bit/beat, bet/bat

**Why it's hard:** Spanish has 5 vowel sounds, English has 12+. Spanish speakers may not hear the difference.

## 🎓 How to Use Results

### After the Game:

1. **Identify Problem Sounds:**
   - Look for words with high "Needs Review" percentages
   - Group by sound category (B/V, TH, R, etc.)

2. **Plan Targeted Lessons:**
   - If TH words scored low → Focus next lesson on TH sounds
   - If B/V words scored low → Review B/V distinction
   - If R words scored low → Practice English R position

3. **Individual Support:**
   - Check student list to see who needs help with which words
   - Create review groups based on sound challenges

4. **Track Progress:**
   - Run the game again after teaching
   - Compare results to see improvement

## 💡 Teaching Tips

### For B/V Sounds:
- Have students feel the difference: B = lips together, V = teeth on lip
- Practice minimal pairs: ball/very, book/vase

### For TH Sounds:
- Show tongue position: between teeth
- Practice: "This" vs "Dis" vs "Tis"

### For R Sounds:
- Demonstrate: tongue back, not rolled
- Practice: "Red" (English) vs "Rrrred" (Spanish)

### For W Sounds:
- Show lip rounding: like saying "oo" but with air
- Practice: "Water" with rounded lips
