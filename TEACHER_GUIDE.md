## Before the Lesson

### Preparation
1. **Print & Cut Cards**: Print cards double-sided, cut them out (2.2" × 1.4")
2. **Storage**: Organize by color/category in small boxes, envelopes, or baggies
3. **Print Scaffolding Guide**: One copy per student or table group
4. **Optional**: Laminate cards for durability

### First-Time Setup (15-20 minutes)
- Introduce card categories one at a time
- Show students how to match colors on front/back
- Demonstrate building ONE simple sentence together
- Explain the color-coding system

## Lesson Structure Suggestions

### Introduction (10-15 min)
1. **Show cards**: Display each category, explain the colors
2. **Build together**: Create one sentence as a class (e.g., "I eat pizza")
3. **Explain the guide**: Show students how to follow the scaffolding levels
4. **Practice rules**: Cards stay on the table, read from left to right

### Main Activity (30-45 min)
- Students work through scaffolding guide levels 1-3 (or assigned level)
- Walk around and check sentences
- Encourage self-correction using guide examples

### Closing (5-10 min)
- Share 2-3 student sentences with class
- Quick review of what they learned

## Common Student Mistakes & How to Help

### 1. **Wrong verb form with He/She/It**
   - **Mistake**: "He eat pizza" 
   - **Fix**: Show them V1 cards say "eat/eats" - need "eats" for He/She/It
   - **Tip**: Have them point to the subject card first, then choose verb form

### 2. **Missing determiners with singular objects**
   - **Mistake**: "She prepares report" (missing "a")
   - **Fix**: Refer to Level 1 tip box - singular objects need determiners
   - **Tip**: Create a visual rule: "If object is ONE thing → need determiner"

### 3. **Wrong verb after "do not"**
   - **Mistake**: "I do not eats" or "She does not prepares"
   - **Fix**: Show them after "do not/does not" ALWAYS use base form (V1)
   - **Tip**: Point to Level 10 (Negative Statements) - rule is clearly stated

### 4. **Confusing V1-ing vs V1 vs V2**
   - **Mistake**: Using "eating" in simple present, or "eat" in past continuous
   - **Fix**: Use color memory - all verbs are green shades but different:
     - Lime green = V1 (simple present)
     - Sage green = V1-ing (continuous)
     - Mint green = V2 (past simple)
   - **Tip**: Ask "Is this happening now?" → use V1-ing

### 5. **Placing cards in wrong order**
   - **Mistake**: "do not" before subject, or object before verb
   - **Fix**: Have them read scaffolding guide formula: Subject → Verb → Object → Time
   - **Tip**: Practice reading cards left-to-right as a sentence

### 6. **Missing connector in past continuous**
   - **Mistake**: "I was cooking" (no second event/time)
   - **Fix**: Refer to Level 6 - past continuous needs "when" or time word
   - **Tip**: Past continuous tells a story - what was happening WHEN something else happened

## How to Check Student Work

### Quick Visual Check:
1. **Color pattern**: Does it match the formula colors in the guide?
2. **Left-to-right**: Subject → Verb → Object? (basic sentence)
3. **Card count**: Too many cards = probably wrong structure

### Question Prompts:
- "Can you read this sentence to me?"
- "What color cards did you use? Do they match the guide?"
- "Look at Level X - does your sentence match that formula?"

### Common Corrections:
- If sentence is wrong, don't fix it for them
- Point to the correct level in guide: "Check Level X formula"
- Ask: "What does the guide say comes after the subject?"

## Differentiation Ideas

### For Struggling Students:
- Start with Level 1 only (Pronouns + V1 + Object)
- Provide sentence frames: "I ___ ___" (blank cards)
- Work in pairs - one student reads guide, other builds
- Give them ONLY the cards they need (pre-select by category)

### For Advanced Students:
- Skip to Level 5 (Present Continuous - Full Sentences)
- Challenge: Build negative sentences
- Challenge: Use connectors to create longer sentences
- Extension: Write their sentences, then trade with partner

### Mixed Levels:
- Set up "stations" by level
- Students move through levels at their own pace
- Provide answer cards for self-checking

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the right card!"
- **Solution**: Organize cards by color before starting
- **Solution**: Check if they're looking at the right category
- **Tip**: Show card backs to help identify category

### "I don't understand the formula"
- **Solution**: Build one sentence together step-by-step
- **Solution**: Use physical demonstration: "This card is Subject, this is Verb..."
- **Tip**: Have them point to each card while reading guide formula

### "All my sentences look the same"
- **Solution**: Encourage them to use different pronouns
- **Solution**: Mix up objects and time words
- **Challenge**: "Can you make 5 different sentences with 'I'?"

### Cards getting messy/lost
- **Prevention**: Use trays or designated table spaces
- **Prevention**: Card limits: "Use only 10 cards at a time"
- **Organization**: Sort cards back by color when done

## Extension Activities

1. **Sentence Race**: "Who can build a sentence first using Level 2 formula?"
2. **Story Building**: Build 3-4 sentences that tell a story
3. **Card Trading**: Students write sentences, trade with partner who rebuilds
4. **Time Challenge**: "Build 5 sentences in 10 minutes"
5. **Sentence Detective**: Teacher builds wrong sentence, students find the mistake

## Assessment Ideas

- **Observation**: Watch how students use cards - do they follow the guide?
- **Quick Check**: Collect 2-3 sentences per student, photograph or have them write
- **Peer Check**: Students check each other's sentences using the guide
- **Exit Ticket**: "Write one sentence you built today" (use card words)

## Time Management Tips

- **First lesson**: Focus on Levels 1-3 only (45 min total)
- **Subsequent lessons**: Add one new level each session
- **Review**: Spend 5 min reviewing previous level before new one
- **Practice**: 20-25 min building, 10 min sharing/checking

## What Makes This Work

✅ **Visual & Tactile**: Students physically manipulate language
✅ **Self-paced**: Scaffolding guide lets students work independently
✅ **Self-checking**: Color-coding helps students catch mistakes
✅ **Progressive**: Builds complexity naturally
✅ **Memorable**: Hands-on learning improves retention

## Common Concerns & Solutions

### "What if students just copy the guide examples?"
- Guide examples use different words than cards (designed this way!)
- Encourage creativity: "Make YOUR own sentence, not the example"
- Check that their sentences are different from guide

### "What if students mix up tenses?"
- This is normal! Guide is organized by tense for a reason
- Start with one tense (simple present) until mastered
- Use color memory: continuous tenses need teal "To Be" cards

### "What if it's too easy/hard for some?"
- That's why there are 10 levels! Let students find their level
- Pair stronger with weaker students for peer teaching
- Provide extension challenges for advanced students

You've created an amazing resource! The key to execution is:
1. Clear introduction (show, don't just tell)
2. Let students explore (they'll figure out the system)
3. Circulate and check (catch mistakes early)
4. Celebrate successes (builds confidence)

Good luck with your lesson! 🎓
