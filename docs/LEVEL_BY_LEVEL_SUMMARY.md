## LEVEL 1: Adding Objects (What?)

### Formula:
**Pronouns** + **V1/V1-3rd** + **(Determiner)** + **Object**

### Sample Sentences Using Actual Cards:

**Positive Examples:**
- **I** + **eat** + **pizza** = "I eat pizza" ✅
- **She** + **cooks** + **a** + **book** = "She cooks a book" ✅ (grammatically correct even if logically odd)
- **They** + **watch** + **TV** = "They watch TV" ✅ (plural object, no determiner)
- **He** + **reads** + **a** + **book** = "He reads a book" ✅ (singular object, needs determiner)

**Negative Examples:**
- **I** + **don't** + **eat** + **pizza** = "I don't eat pizza" ✅
- **She** + **doesn't** + **cook** + **a** + **book** = "She doesn't cook a book" ✅

### ✅ What to Look For:

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
   - ✅ **He/She/It** uses V1-3rd form (cooks, reads, goes)
   - ✅ **I/You/We/They** uses V1 base form (cook, read, go)
   - ❌ WRONG: "He cook" or "They cooks"

2. **Determiner Usage:**
   - ✅ Singular objects (book) → needs determiner (a, an, the, my, your)
   - ✅ Plural/uncountable objects (pizza, coffee, English, homework, TV, bus, music) → NO determiner
   - ❌ WRONG: "She reads book" (missing determiner for singular)
   - ❌ WRONG: "I eat a pizza" (unnecessary determiner for plural/uncountable)

3. **Negative Sentences:**
   - ✅ After "do not/does not" → ALWAYS use V1 base form
   - ✅ "I do not eat" (not "eats")
   - ✅ "She does not cook" (not "cooks")
   - ❌ WRONG: "I do not eats" or "She does not cooks"

4. **Card Order:**
   - ✅ Pronouns → Helper Verb (if negative) → V1 → Determiner (if needed) → Object
   - ❌ Cards in random order

---

## LEVEL 2: Adding Time Words (When?)

### Formula:
**Pronouns** + **V1/V1-3rd** + **Object** + **Time**

### Sample Sentences Using Actual Cards:

**Positive Examples:**
- **I** + **eat** + **pizza** + **every day** = "I eat pizza every day" ✅
- **She** + **works** + **now** = "She works now" ✅
- **They** + **watch** + **TV** + **usually** = "They watch TV usually" ✅
- **He** + **reads** + **a** + **book** + **tomorrow** = "He reads a book tomorrow" ✅

**Negative Examples:**
- **I** + **don't** + **eat** + **pizza** + **every day** = "I don't eat pizza every day" ✅
- **She** + **doesn't** + **work** + **now** = "She doesn't work now" ✅

### ✅ What to Look For:

1. **Time Word Placement:**
   - ✅ Time can go at end: "I eat pizza every day"
   - ✅ Time can go at beginning: "Every day I eat pizza" (but cards usually show end placement)
   - ⚠️ Some awkward but acceptable: "He reads a book tomorrow" (future meaning with present tense)

2. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
   - ✅ Still check: He/She/It uses V1-3rd form
   - ✅ Still check: Negative uses V1 base form after helper verb

3. **All Previous Checks:**
   - ✅ Determiner usage (singular objects need it)
   - ✅ Negative helper verb + V1 base form

---

## LEVEL 3: Adding Places (Where?)

### Formula:
**Pronouns** + **V1/V1-3rd** + **Object** + **Preposition** + **Place**

### Sample Sentences Using Actual Cards:

**Positive Examples:**
- **I** + **go** + **to** + **school** = "I go to school" ✅
- **She** + **works** + **at** + **home** = "She works at home" ✅
- **They** + **play** + **in** + **the** + **park** = "They play in the park" ✅ (needs determiner with place)
- **He** + **studies** + **at** + **work** = "He studies at work" ✅

**Negative Examples:**
- **I** + **don't** + **go** + **to** + **school** = "I don't go to school" ✅
- **She** + **doesn't** + **work** + **at** + **home** = "She doesn't work at home" ✅

### ✅ What to Look For:

1. **Preposition + Place:**
   - ✅ Common combinations: "at home", "at school", "at work", "in the park", "to school"
   - ⚠️ Some places need determiner: "in the park", "at the school" (though "at school" also works)
   - ❌ WRONG: Missing preposition: "I go school"

2. **Preposition Choice:**
   - ✅ "at" for locations (at home, at work, at school)
   - ✅ "in" for contained spaces (in the park)
   - ✅ "to" for direction (to school, to work, to home)

3. **All Previous Checks:**
   - ✅ Subject-verb agreement
   - ✅ Determiner usage
   - ✅ Negative helper verb usage

## LEVEL 4: Past Simple (V2)

### Formula:
**Pronouns** + **V2** + **Object** + **Time**

### Sample Sentences Using Actual Cards:

**Positive Examples:**
- **I** + **ate** + **pizza** + **yesterday** = "I ate pizza yesterday" ✅
- **She** + **worked** + **last night** = "She worked last night" ✅
- **They** + **watched** + **TV** + **last night** = "They watched TV last night" ✅
- **He** + **read** + **a** + **book** + **yesterday** = "He read a book yesterday" ✅

**Negative Examples:**
- **I** + **didn't** + **eat** + **pizza** + **yesterday** = "I didn't eat pizza yesterday" ✅
- **She** + **didn't** + **work** + **last night** = "She didn't work last night" ✅

### ✅ What to Look For:

1. **V2 Cards for Positive:**
   - ✅ Use V2 cards (ate, worked, watched, went, studied, played, cooked, read, slept, cleaned, drove, talked, had, did, lived, needed, wanted)
   - ❌ WRONG: "I eat pizza yesterday" (should be "ate")

2. **CRITICAL: Negative Uses V1:**
   - ✅ After "didn't" → ALWAYS use V1 base form (eat, work, watch, NOT ate, worked, watched)
   - ✅ "I didn't eat" (not "ate")
   - ✅ "She didn't work" (not "worked")
   - ❌ WRONG: "I didn't ate" or "She didn't worked"

3. **Time Words:**
   - ✅ Past simple often uses: **yesterday**, **last night**, **last week**
   - ✅ Helps show it's past tense

4. **Subject-Verb Agreement (No 3rd person -s in past):**
   - ✅ "He worked" (not "works" - that's present!)
   - ✅ "She ate" (not "eats")

---

**Negative Examples:**
- **I** + **won't** + **eat** + **pizza** + **tomorrow** = "I won't eat pizza tomorrow" ✅
- **She** + **won't** + **work** + **next weekend** = "She won't work next weekend" ✅

### ✅ What to Look For:

1. **"will" Helper Verb:**
   - ✅ Always use **will** card (not "going to" - not available)
   - ✅ All subjects use same form: "I will", "She will", "They will"
   - ✅ No subject-verb agreement needed!

2. **V1 Base Form After "will":**
   - ✅ Always use V1 base form (eat, work, watch, NOT eats, works, ate, working)
   - ✅ "I will eat" (not "eats" or "eating")
   - ❌ WRONG: "I will eats" or "I will ate"

3. **Negative: "won't":**
   - ✅ Use **won't** card
   - ✅ Still V1 base form after: "I won't eat"

   - ✅ **I** → **am** or **am not**
   - ✅ **You/We/They** → **are** or **aren't**
   - ✅ **He/She/It** → **is** or **isn't**
   - ❌ WRONG: "I is eating" or "They am watching"

2. **V1-ing Form:**

   - ❌ WRONG: "I am eat" (need "eating")

3. **No Helper Verbs in Positive:**

   - ✅ Affirmative past continuous MUST have:
     - Either a **Connector** (when, while, before) + second event

   - ✅ Pattern: will + be + V1-ing

2. **V1-ing After "be":**
