## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
❌ Bad: "Make a worksheet about verbs"
✅ Good: "Create a worksheet about Present Simple vs Present Continuous tenses. Students will complete 15 sentences by choosing the correct tense. Include time words like 'usually', 'now', 'today' to help them decide."

### Think About Your Students
- What level are they?
- What do they struggle with?
- What format do they like? (games, worksheets, quizzes?)

### Provide Examples
If you have example questions or content, include them in the "Additional Information" section. The AI can use these as inspiration.

### Ask for Modifications
After you get your activity, you can ask the AI to:
- Change colors or styling
- Add more questions
- Make it easier/harder
- Add or remove features
- Make it print-friendly

Just ask it to modify! You can say:

### "What if I want something specific?"
Include it in the "Additional Information" section! The more details you provide, the better the result.

## Troubleshooting

- Ask the AI to modify it: "Can you make it more like [describe what you want]?"

### "I don't understand HTML"
- You don't need to! Just:
  1. Copy the HTML code the AI gives you
  2. Save it as a `.html` file
  3. Open it in a browser
- That's it!

### "Can I edit the activity after?"
